<p>When I was trying to install Genymotion on Ubuntu 14.04, I got this error</p>
<p>    Installing log handler<br />
    Logging activities to file: &#47;home&#47;****<br />
    Aborted (core dumped)</p>
<p>the log file &#47;home&#47;xx&#47;.Genymotion&#47;genymotion.log has the following message:</p>
<p>    ... [Genymotion] [Fatal] Cannot mix incompatible Qt library (version 0x40806) with this library (version 0x40804)</p>
<p>The reason of this error is that Genymotion has its own Qt library which is not compatable with the system Qt library.</p>
<p>To fix this error, we need to let genymotion use system's Qt library. The following commands can fix this issue</p>
<p>    sudo apt-get install libxi-dev libxmu-dev<br />
    # go to your genymotion directory<br />
    mkdir QtLibs && mv *Qt*.so* QtLibs</p>
