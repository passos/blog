<p>I am trying to build a self-contain GLIBC 2.7. It shows following error when I run ```configure```</p>
<p>    checking whether ranlib is necessary... no<br />
    checking LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable... contains current directory<br />
    configure: error:<br />
    *** LD_LIBRARY_PATH shouldn't contain the current directory when<br />
    *** building glibc. Please change the environment variable<br />
    *** and run configure again.</p>
<p>my LD_LIBRARY_PATH is </p>
<p>    $ echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH<br />
    &#47;home&#47;sliu&#47;opt&#47;lib:&#47;home&#47;sliu&#47;opt&#47;libexec&#47;gcc&#47;x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu&#47;4.8.1:&#47;home&#47;sliu&#47;opt&#47;lib64:&#47;home&#47;sliu&#47;opt&#47;lib64&#47;gcj-4.8.1-14:</p>
<p>The error message complains that LD_LIBRARY_PATH contain the current directory. However my LD_LIBRARY_PATH doesn't contain any "current directory". Actually, it's caused by the path seperate character ":" instead of "current directory". If you search LD_LIBRARY_PATH in ```configure```, you will find this comments</p>
<p>    # Test if LD_LIBRARY_PATH contains the notation for the current directory<br />
    # since this would lead to problems installing&#47;building glibc.<br />
    # LD_LIBRARY_PATH contains the current directory if one of the following<br />
    # is true:<br />
    # - one of the terminals (":" and ";") is the first or last sign<br />
    # - two terminals occur directly after each other<br />
    # - the path contains an element with a dot in it</p>
<p>Which means, **The LD_LIBRARY_PATH can not start or end with character ":".**</p>
<p>So this issue can be fixed by removing the last ':' character in LD_LIBRARY_PATH.</p>
<p>解决办法就是，去掉 LD_LIBRARY_PATH 最后的那个路径分隔符':'.</p>
